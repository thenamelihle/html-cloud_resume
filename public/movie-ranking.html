<h1>The Best Movies According to Lihle</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Saltburn</h3>

<p>Twisted protagonist. Overall wierdo. In the end he fucks the rich over so he's alright.</p>

<h3>The Creator</h3>

<p>It tackles moral and ethical gray areas that may arise when AI becomes sentient.</p>

<h3>Isle of Dogs</h3>

<p>Cool Wes Anderson animation. Stellar VO cast with the driest, funniest dialogue among dogs in a dumpster.</p>
