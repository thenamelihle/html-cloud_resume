<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hey there! I'm Lihle, a passionate IT professional based in Cape Town, South Africa. With a background in IT Support, 
  I've developed a knack for problem-solving and a love for all things tech.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond my IT expertise, I have a wide palette of interests, including music, coding, art, and navigating 
  the social realm. I can talk about cartoons, movies, and tech for hours, and I'm always eager to learn and explore new ideas.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, I'm looking to transition into a role as a DevOps Engineer or Cloud Support Engineer, seeking new challenges beyond 
  Desktop support. I'm also working on creating a feature for Mac similar to Windows Spotlight, showcasing my passion for innovation 
  and user experience.

<p>
  In my free time, I create DJ mixes for my series For the Houseplants, which is a sonic series that brings life to your space just as
  it does to your leafy friends. .
